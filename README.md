Various prototype PCB's
===========
This repository contains various little boards like level shifters, component breakouts and other simple PCB's. Most of these boards are breadboard plugin friendly and are available at OSH park.

Levelshifters are always useful
<h2 align="center">NXP Mosfet style</h2>
Simple single transistor based level shifter, used for 3.3V to 5V bidirectional conversion.
<h2 align="center">GTL2003</h2>
NXP has released NVT200X (X is the bit count) and the older (but equavelent) GTL2003 (8 bits). These are breakout boards that use the 8 bit variant. Fun fact: you can probably use these too as current sink mirrors.
