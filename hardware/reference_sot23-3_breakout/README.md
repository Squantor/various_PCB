# SOT23 3 pin reference breakout
Most SOT23 references have the same pinout, this breakout accomodates these references. These include the MCP1525 and various linear reference chips.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (TODO)
* PCB layout (TODO)
* Review with one night in between (TODO)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/) (TODO)
* Assemble (TODO)
* Test & characterise (TODO)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM (TODO)
## BOM
Due to the general shortage of passive components, where mentioned, just whatever you can find.
* Any 3 pin SOT23 references
* footprints available for capacitors in 0805 and 0603
