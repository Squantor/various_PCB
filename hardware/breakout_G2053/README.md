# G2053 dual halfbridge breakout
Simple breakout board with application schematic for the [G2053 dual H-bridge, current controlled hbridge chip](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Motor-Drivers_GMT-Global-Mixed-mode-Tech-G2053FC1U_C528076.html) by [GMT(Global Mixed-mode Technology)](http://www.gmt.com.tw/).
This is a cheap dual H-bridge IC with decent current handling for stepper motors, brushed motor or other power drive.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise with a few tests
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* The G2053 can be found at [LCSC](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Motor-Drivers_GMT-Global-Mixed-mode-Tech-G2053FC1U_C528076.html) for only 0.26 USD (June 2020 pricing)
* Use a 10uF ceramic capacitor that can handle the higher voltage but also does not lower when used at a higher voltage, so dont cheap out and use X5R ceramic or at least derate that properly
