# USB armor
Small circuit to protect your phone from usb hacks like like [BADUSB](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/08/02/badusb-what-if-you-could-never-trust-a-usb-device-again/).
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (REDO), mistake in input USB connector, GND/VCC flipped!
* PCB layout (REDO)
* Review with one night in between (TODO)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/) (TODO)
* Assemble (TODO)
* Test & characterise (TODO)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM (TODO)
