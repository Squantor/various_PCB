# Dual PDIP right side opamp circuit
This board contains bunch of components to make various circuits on the right side of a dual opamp. These circuits include 
* Inverting amplifier
* Non inverting amplifier
* transimpedance amplifier
* Sallen Key filter
The passive component footprints are multifunctional 0805/0603/2.5mm hole raster so you can put various parts in there.
