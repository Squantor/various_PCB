# SOT23 3 pin breakout
Simple SOT23 3 pin breakout. Ideal for breadboarding small mosfets and such.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (Done)
* PCB layout (Done)
* Review with one night in between (Done)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/qDetQDpD) (WIP)
* Assemble (TODO)
# BOM
Simplest bom ever!
* Any 3 pin connector, I prefer turned pin headers for not damaging your breadboard
* A SOT-23 of choice. I usually use mosfets as they are getting harder to get in TH technology. Modern ones with 1.8V Vth only are in SMT housings.
