# MCP1702 SOT23 breakout
Simple breakout for the SOT23 packaged MCP1702
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (WIP)
* PCB layout (TODO)
* Review with one night in between (TODO)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/) (TODO)
* Assemble (TODO)
* Test & characterise (TODO)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM (TODO)
## BOM
Due to the general shortage of passive components, where mentioned, just whatever you can find.
* [MCP1702](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/22008E.pdf)
Dual 0805/0603 footprint present to accomodate a few capacitor types.
