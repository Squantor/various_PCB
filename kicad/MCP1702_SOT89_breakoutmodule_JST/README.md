# MCP1702 breakout and module
This is a breakout for the MCP1702 LDO, it is breadboard friendly but two JST PH connectors make it also possible to use it in a cable. The MCP1702 has additional thermal vias and a large plane to help with power dissipation.

## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (in progress)
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/) 
* Assemble
* Test 
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
