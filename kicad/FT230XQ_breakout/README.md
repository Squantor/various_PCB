# FT230XQ breakout
Simple breakout board for the FT230XQ USB to serial converter. The pinout matches the standard FTDI cable pinout but there is also a 4 pin pinout with just RX/TX. Next to the FTDI chip there is also a high current regulator for supplying 3.3V, this is completely separate from VIO of the FTDI so is completely optional. RX, TX and power LED's are present.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (done)
* PCB layout (done)
* Review with one night in between (done)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/) (WIP)
* Assemble (TODO)
* Test & characterise (TODO)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM (TODO)
## BOM
Due to the general shortage of passive components, where mentioned, just whatever you can find. Mostly 0402 components are used.
* component from [farnell](https://www.farnell.com/)
* Generic resistor in 0402 housing with a value
* Generic capacitor in 0603 housing with a value
