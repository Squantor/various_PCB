# GTL2003 breakout #
This board is a simple breakout for the [GTL2003](http://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/ic-bus-portfolio/ic-voltage-level-translators/8-bit-bidirectional-low-voltage-translator:GTL2003) levelshifter by NXP. It contains footprints for all the pull up resistors and the biasing for the levelshifter itself.
## Usage ##
NXP has created [AN10145](http://www.nxp.com/documents/application_note/AN10145.pdf) for usage for these types of levelshifters.

As this is a bunch of N-MOSFET's on a single die with the same geometry and interconnected gates. This device would also be very useful as a current mirror.
