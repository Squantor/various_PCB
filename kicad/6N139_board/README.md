6N139 breakout
===========
This board is a simple 6N139 breakout board with footprints for all the supporting resistors. Currently under test and characterisation of the resistors, full list will be given soon.
Warning: Please use real 6N139's from a reputable source. China bought optocouplers are downright bad or non functional.
