# Raspberry Pi Pico SWD adapter board
The three pin connection of the raspberry pi pico board is inconvienient to say the least. This will break it out to a standard 10 pin ARM SWD/JTAG connection
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* 2*5 1.27mm pitch header
* 3 pin 2.54mm pitch angled female header
