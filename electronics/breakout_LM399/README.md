# LM399 breakout
Very simple breakout for the LM399 voltage reference to check the footprint (And cutouts)
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* [LM399](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/199399fc.pdf) voltage reference
