# Little logic breakout for 5 pin SOT353 packages
Simple breakout board for little logic devices in SOT353 case.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* any 5 pin little logic in SOT353 has this pinout with VDD/VSS in these positions
