# SOT666 breakout
Simple breakout for the SOT666 package. This board is not producable at Oshpark, inter pin spacing too small.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
