# 32KHz low power oscillator experiment
This is a test board for a very low power 32KHz crystal oscillator. Idea from [this](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/9/982.html) application note.
## TODO's
* Fill in this project description
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* [74X1GX04](https://www.lcsc.com/search?q=1gx04) crystal oscillator amplifier.
* NPN BJT transistor with a gain of 100 at 5uA
