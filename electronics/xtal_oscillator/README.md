# Crystal oscillator
Small crystal oscillator PCB using the 1GX04 style pierce oscillator and driver logic IC.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* Any crystal in 3225 housing, you can also fit smaller crystals in that same footprint with some positioning
* any 1GX04 chip from nexperia or TI
