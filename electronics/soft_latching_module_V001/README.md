# Template project
Simple soft latching power circuit, intended to be used with a microcontroller. Inspired by this [forum post on eevblog forums](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/push-button-power-circuit-for-arduino-trying-to-modify-it-for-12v-input/).
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (TODO)
* PCB layout (TODO)
* Review with one night in between (TODO)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/) (TODO)
* Assemble (TODO)
* Test & characterise (TODO)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM (TODO)
## BOM
Maybe the only critical part is the MOSFET. Take into account your load, standoff voltage and maximum voltage you want to switch and size your P channel MOSFET appropriatly. This circuit just has a SOT-23 3 pin footprint for now. This is intended for microcontroller projects
