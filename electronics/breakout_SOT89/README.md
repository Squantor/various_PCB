# Simple breakout for SOT89 devices
Really simple breakout for SOT89 devices. The centre pin is connected to a large copper area.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
