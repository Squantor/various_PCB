# Ikea Livecam holder LED ring
PCB with LEDS and cross laser powersupply for the Ikea lamp Microsoft Livecam microscope.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
* Osram high CRI LED in 5630 package
* LM7805A from Shikues (has higher output current of 200mA)
* TLV431 shunt regulator in SOT23 for laser current control (any 1.24Vref 431 would be suitable)
