# SOT23-5 opamp to PDIP-8 converter
Small converter PCB that converts a SOT23-5 opamp to a PDIP-8 footprint
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Fill in this project description
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
This is a list of hardware components. If just mentioned a generic component like a 1K 0402 resistor, just name it as such, free to substitute. If you need some special integrated IC's show some sources like Mouser, Digikey, Farnell, or LCSC
* Generic SOT23-5 opamp like LM321
