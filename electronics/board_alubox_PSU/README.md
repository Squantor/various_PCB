# 10x10cm alubox module powersupply
4 by 5cm module with powersupply components. Two AC inputs one for a symmetrical powersupply and one for a single ended powersupply. Symmetric powersupply accepts LM317/LM337 regulators. Single ended supply has footprints for a LM317 regulator and LM78XX style regulators. All regulators are TO220 with a small heatsink. Due to limited space for capacitance the amount of current is also limited.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (WIP)
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
This is a list of hardware components. If just mentioned a generic component like a 1K 0402 resistor, just name it as such, free to substitute. If you need some special integrated IC's show some sources like Mouser, Digikey, Farnell, or LCSC
* TO220 LM317, LM337, LM78XX style regulator
* SMA cased diodes
* Very skinny capacitors but substitute for your own
* 500mA trip polyfuses
