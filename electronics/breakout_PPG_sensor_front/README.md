# PPG components breakout
Small test project that places all the needed optical components for PPG ([photoplethysmogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram)) sensor on a PCB. This includes the Green high brightness LED's and a visual range sensitivty photodiode. These components are usually in a housing that require cutouts in the PCB so they can sit flush with the other side. This breakout will test this.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry (TODO)
* PCB layout (TODO)
* Review with one night in between (TODO)
* Produce at [OSHPARK](https://oshpark.com/) (TODO)
* Assemble (TODO)
* Test & characterise (TODO)
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM (TODO)
## BOM
Used components:
* Kingbright [KPTR-3216ZGC](https://www.kingbright.com/attachments/file/psearch/000/00/00/KPTR-3216ZGC(Ver.12B).pdf) reverse mount 525nm (Green) LED.
* OSRAM [SFH 2440](https://www.osram.com/ecat/DIL%20SMT%20Ambient%20Light%20Sensor%20SFH%202440/com/en/class_pim_web_catalog_103489/global/prd_pim_device_2219615/) ambient light sensor.
