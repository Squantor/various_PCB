# VPS8701 push pull converter DIM
A DIM (Dual Inline Module) breakout with VPS8701 and push pull transformer for experiments/tryouts with symmetrical isolated unnregulated powersupplies.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Produce at [Aisler](https://aisler.net/)
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
This is a list of hardware components. If just mentioned a generic component like a 1K 0402 resistor, just name it as such, free to substitute. If you need some special integrated IC's show some sources like Mouser, Digikey, Farnell, or LCSC
* Any small push pull transformer
* VPS8701 push pull transformer driver IC
